Now that the Internet bubble has burst, what's next? With the dust starting to settle, some issues are coming to the forefront that will potentially define over a long term the use of information and educational technology by different sectors of the population.

*   **Access** - Will the networked society be inclusive, or is there a danger that certain sectors of the population will be left out?
*   **Learning** - What are the media forms that will mediate learning, and what are the key pedagogial considerations?
*   **Sustaining models** - What are the strategies by which we will sustain creation and use of media forms for learning?

We will study these issues through lectures and demonstrations, readings and class discussions, student reports, and a final project. Guest speakers include the following:

*   **John Belcher** - Professor of Physics and head of Studio Physics Project/Technology Enabled Active Learning Project at MIT.
*   **Nolan Bowie** - Kennedy School of Government, Senior Fellow and Adjunct Lecturer in Public Policy
*   **Anne Margulies** - Executive Director, MIT OpenCourseWare
*   **Brenda Matthis** - Expert on unintended biases in software design, Lesley College
*   **Lisa Neal** - Editor-In-Chief, eLearn Magazine
